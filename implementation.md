Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): You'll need to implement logic to control which parts of the application different user roles can access. Laravel provides several ways to do this, including:

Middleware: Create middleware (e.g., AdminMiddleware) to check if a user has the 'admin' role before allowing access to certain routes.
Policies: Define policies to handle more complex authorization logic for specific models and actions.
Blade Directives: Use @can and @cannot directives in your Blade templates to conditionally display UI elements based on user roles.
Why this is crucial: Establishing user roles is fundamental to your system's security and functionality. It allows you to differentiate between administrators who can upload and manage papers and students who can browse and download them.

Create Your Core Database Models and Migrations:

Generate Models: For each of the key tables you've defined (Department, StudentType, Level, Paper, PaperVersion, Download, SearchHistory), create corresponding Eloquent models:

Bash

php artisan make:model Department -m  // -m creates the migration as well
php artisan make:model StudentType -m
php artisan make:model Level -m
php artisan make:model Paper -m
php artisan make:model PaperVersion -m
php artisan make:model Download -m
php artisan make:model SearchHistory -m
Define Table Schemas in Migrations: Open each generated migration file (in the database/migrations directory) and define the table structure and relationships as you outlined. For example, the papers table migration would include columns like title, file_path, department_id (as a foreign key referencing the departments table), student_type_id, level_id, user_id (foreign key to the users table), and so on. Remember to define foreign key constraints.

PHP

Schema::create('papers', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('title');
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->string('file_path');
    $table->foreignId('department_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->string('semester')->nullable();
    $table->string('exam_type')->nullable();
    $table->string('course_name')->nullable();
    $table->year('exam_year')->nullable();
    $table->foreignId('student_type_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->foreignId('level_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->string('visibility')->default('public');
    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->timestamps();
});
Run Migrations: After defining all your table schemas, run the migrations to create the tables in your SQLite database:

Bash

php artisan migrate
Why this is crucial: Your database structure is the backbone of your application. Defining it correctly early on ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Start Building Your First Livewire Components (Focus on Admin Paper Upload):

Generate the Livewire Component: Create the PaperUploader Livewire component:

Bash

php artisan make:livewire Admin/PaperUploader
This will create two files: app/Livewire/Admin/PaperUploader.php (the component class) and resources/views/livewire/admin/paper-uploader.blade.php (the component view).

Implement the UI in the Blade View: Design the form for uploading a paper. This will include fields for the paper title, description, selecting the file, department, student type, level, exam type, course name, exam year, and visibility. Use standard HTML form elements and Livewire's data binding (wire:model).

Blade

<div>
    <h2>Upload New Exam Paper</h2>
    <form wire:submit.prevent="uploadPaper">
        <div>
            <label for="title">Title:</label>
            <input type="text" id="title" wire:model="title">
            @error('title') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="file">File:</label>
            <input type="file" id="file" wire:model="file">
            @error('file') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror
            @if ($temporaryUrl)
                <p>Preview: <a href="{{ $temporaryUrl }}" target="_blank">View File</a></p>
            @endif
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</div>
Implement the Logic in the Component Class: In the PaperUploader.php file, define the properties to bind to your form fields ($title, $file, etc.) and the uploadPaper() method. This method will handle:

Validation: Use Laravel's validation rules to ensure the uploaded file and metadata are valid.
File Storage: Use Laravel's File Storage to save the uploaded PDF file to the designated location.
Database Interaction: Create a new Paper record in the database with the collected metadata and the file path.
Displaying Success/Error Messages: Provide feedback to the user.

    use WithFileUploads;

    public $title;

    public $levels;
    public $temporaryUrl;

    public function mount()
    {
        $this->departments = Department::all();
        $this->studentTypes = StudentType::all();
        $this->levels = collect(); // Will be loaded based on student type
    }

    public function updatedStudentTypeId($value)
    {
        $this->levels = Level::where('student_type_id', $value)->get();
        $this->level_id = null; // Reset level when student type changes
    }

    public function updatedFile()
    {
        $this->validate([
            'file' => 'required|mimes:pdf|max:10240', // Max 10MB
        ]);
        $this->temporaryUrl = $this->file->temporaryUrl();
    }

    public function uploadPaper()
    {
        $this->validate([
            'title' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'description' => 'nullable|string',
            'file' => 'required|mimes:pdf|max:10240',
            'department_id' => 'required|exists:departments,id',
            'semester' => 'nullable|string|max:50',
            'exam_type' => 'nullable|string|max:50',
            'course_name' => 'nullable|string|max:255',
            'exam_year' => 'nullable|digits:4|integer|min:1900|max:' . date('Y'),
            'student_type_id' => 'required|exists:student_types,id',
            'level_id' => 'required|exists:levels,id',
            'visibility' => 'required|in:public,private',
        ]);

        $path = $this->file->store('exam_papers'); // Store in storage/app/exam_papers
        Paper::create([
            'title' => $this->title,
            'description' => $this->description,
            'file_path' => $path,
            'department_id' => $this->department_id,
            'semester' => $this->semester,
            'exam_type' => $this->exam_type,
            'course_name' => $this->course_name,
            'exam_year' => $this->exam_year,
            'student_type_id' => $this->student_type_id,
            'level_id' => $this->level_id,
            'visibility' => $this->visibility,
            'user_id' => auth()->id(), // Assuming users are logged in
        ]);

        session()->flash('message', 'Paper uploaded successfully!');
        $this->reset();
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.admin.paper-uploader');
    }
}
Route and Display the Component: Create an admin-only route (using middleware) to display the PaperUploader component in a Blade view.

PHP

// In routes/web.php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () { return view('admin.dashboard'); })->name('admin.dashboard');
    Route::get('/papers/upload', \App\Livewire\Admin\PaperUploader::class)->name('admin.papers.upload');
    // ... other admin routes
});
Create a corresponding Blade view (resources/views/admin/papers/upload.blade.php) to render the Livewire component:

Blade

<x-app-layout>
    <x-slot name="header">
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight">
            {{ __('Upload Exam Paper') }}
        </h2>
    </x-slot>

    <div class="py-12">
        <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
            <div class="bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg">
                @livewire('admin.paper-uploader')
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</x-app-layout>
Why this is crucial: Starting with the paper upload functionality allows you to begin populating your system with data, which is essential for testing and developing the student-facing features later. Building it as a Livewire component will give you hands-on experience with Livewire's data binding, form handling, and file uploads.
